        greedy_star1_coloring

Find a coloring of a given input graph such that
no two vertices connected by an edge have the same
color using greedy approach. The number of colors
used may be equal or greater than the chromatic
number `Ï‡(G)` of the graph.

A star coloring is a special type of distance - 1  coloring,
For a coloring to be called a star coloring, it must satisfy
two conditions:

1. every pair of adjacent vertices receives distinct  colors
(a distance-1 coloring)

2. For any vertex v, any color that leads to a two-colored path
involving v and three other vertices  is  impermissible  for  v.
In other words, every path on four vertices uses at least three
colors.
