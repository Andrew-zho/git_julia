# Function Building and Compilation (build_function)

At any time, callable functions can be generated from ModelingToolkit IR by using
`convert(Expr,x)`. This performs some cleaning to return an expression without
extraneous pieces that commonly matches expressions one would write in functions
like those for differential equation solvers and optimization libraries. These
functions can be automatically parallelize and specialize on Julia types like
static arrays and sparse matrices.

The core compilation process of ModelingToolkit IR is `build_function`.
`build_function` takes an operation or an `AbstractArray` of operations and
generates a compilable version of the model for numerical solvers. The form of
this output is dependent on the `target`. By default, the target outputs
Julia code, but other formats, such as C, Stan, and MATLAB are available.
These can be generated as expressions which can then be evaluated into a callable
function, or the compilers for the respective targets can be invoked to directly
give back the function handle.
